```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yuanbohan/tunnel/main/install.sh | VERSION=v0.1.2 sh

Supported targets:

The installer writes `tunnel` to `~/.local/bin/tunnel`.
Official releases also publish signed checksums used by native `tunnel update` and `tunnel rollback`.

Manual lifecycle commands:

```sh
tunnel update
tunnel rollback
```

Interactive `tunnel run ...` also checks for updates at most once every 24 hours and may prompt before startup when a newer official release is available.

```sh
tunnel --version
```
